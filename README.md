# Band Gap Prediction for Low-Dimensional Hybride Metal(III) Halides by Mashine Learning

This work is dedicated to solve QSPR task for Band Gap (BG) of hybrid antimony(III) and bismuth(III) halides with $\\{MHal_{4}\\}^{-}\ (M = Bi^{+3}, Sb^{+3}; Hal = I^{-}, Br^{-}, Cl^{-})$ anion type. The repository contains the sources data, trained models, code for training and prediction, and a small part on data analysis. It is expected that this will be an addition to a scientific article.

At the moment, only a part of the metal(III) halides dataset is presented, it will be fully available after the article is rejected.
